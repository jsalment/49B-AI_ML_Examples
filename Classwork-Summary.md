# MS Computer Science Coursework Summary





This folder contains the code for the fine-tuning GPT2 using subreddit comments. Below I summarize the Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) classes I took for my masters degree in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.  I took three varieties of classes related to AI/ML, theorical machine learning, machine learning applications, and an AI survey course. A brief summary of the objectives and work for each course is below my category.



1. ### Theorical Machine Learning



* ##### Introduction to Machine Learning



This course covered the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives, including Bayesian Networks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. This course covered theoretical concepts such as inductive bias, the PAC learning framework, Bayesian learning methods, margin-based learning, and Occam’s Razor. Programming assignments included hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. This course focused the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning. For this course, I implemented and analyzed existing learning algorithms, including well-studied methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, and representation learning; integrated data preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection in a single system; and designed experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques.



* ##### Intermediate Deep Learning



This course covered the foundational ideas and the recent advances in deep learning for supervised learning and unsupervised learning tasks. For supervised learning, topics included neural networks, back-propagation algorithm, convolutional models, recurrent neural networks, and their extensions with applications to image recognition, video analysis, and language modelling. For unsupervised learning, topics included variational autoencoders, sparse-coding, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks.



* ##### Deep Reinforcement Learning \& Control



This course focused on developing agents that can learn to sense and act in the world by imitating others, maximizing sparse rewards, and/or satisfying their curiosity. I implemented with methods for learning behavioral policies supervised by reinforcement, demonstrations and/or intrinsic curiosity; and evaluated the sample complexity, generalization and generality of these algorithms.



### 2\. Machine Learning Applications



* ##### Applied Machine Learning



This course covered the underlying theoretical assumptions behind a wide variety of statistical models, how to analyze the performance of such models, and how to integrate models into data processing pipelines. This course introduced a broad survey of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, including fundamentals in the setup and evaluation of linear and non-linear statistical models.



* ##### Machine Learning in Practice



This course covered data management, model development, deployment, and business/organizational impacts for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems. This course included the implementation of data pipelines and data engineering systems, the calculation of the approximate value provided by a machine learning system, and the continual assessment of the value and quality of a deployed machine learning system.



* ##### Computer Vision



This course covered include image processing basics, Hough Transforms, feature detection, feature descriptors, image representations, image classification and object detection. It also covered camera geometry, multi-view geometry, stereo, 3D reconstruction from images, optical flow, motion analysis and tracking. For this course, I implemented the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image; extracted SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification; performed object recognition using a convolutional neural network; detected Harris Corners and implement the RANSAC algorithm to find the homography between two images; performed 3D reconstruction and stereo rectification to implement stereo block matching using two images; implemented a gradient descent based image alignment algorithm to track objects in a video; used Python and PyTorch.



### 3\. AI Survey Course



* ##### Graduate Artificial Intelligence



This course provided a broad perspective on AI, covering classical approaches of search and planning; integer programming and continuous optimization; modern machine learning techniques including deep learning; game theory and multi-agent systems; and issues of bias and unfairness in AI.
